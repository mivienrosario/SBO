# SBO - Attendance and Evaluation System

Project Est. 2018 - 2019

Every semester or every school year, the University or a college department hold various events for its students as part of its extracurricular activities. Some examples of these events are foundation day, intramurals, school seminars or workshops, etc. Aside from promoting a university's campus life, it helps promote students develop dynamic personalities apart from excelling in academic endeavours. While these events are great opportunities for students to grow, not every student are willing to attend, hence, the University's "Community Service" system where absentees are required to perform community service for the campus as a consequence of not attending the said events.

The events have two important details: log in and log out. The in/out system has a duration of 30 minutes up to 1-hour. Some events have a whole day of duration, and an event always can always be broken down into 1-2 parts: morning and afternoon. 

Example A:

### August 21, 2019 (Morning Event)
`Time In: 7:30 AM - 8:30 AM`
`Time Out: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM`

Example B: 

### August 25, 2019 (Whole day Event)
`Time In: 7:30 AM - 8:30 AM`
`Time Out: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM`
`Time In: 1:00 PM - 1:30 PM`
`Time Out: 3:30 PM - 4:30 PM`

---

Each Time In/Time Out correspond to one absence and each absence is equivalent to an hour worth of community service. On special occassions, an absence can be equivalent to two to three hours depending on the SBO's discretion.
